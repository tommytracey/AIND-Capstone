Use the [`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split()`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) function to create separate training & test datasets, then retrain each of the models using only the training set and evaluate the prediction accuracy using the hold out test set.
